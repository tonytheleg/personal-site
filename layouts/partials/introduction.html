My name is Tony and I'm a big fan of Linux and Open Source technologies. 
I enjoy learning new technologies, and problem solving. 
I get excited about logistics, process improvement, and creating tools to improve day-to-day operations for humans and machines, and am passionate about documentation
I yearn to grow as a Site/Platform Reliability Engineer, dividing my time with Engineering, Development, and even Operations work.
I'm happiest when working on providing a stable platform for customers to deploy their applications. I'm even happier when automating and creating tools to improve process and efficiency. 
When I'm not at work, I spend time expanding my skill set learning new technologies and platforms. Currently I am focusing on improving my coding skills through Python and Go as well as various other technologies that are revolutionig the industry. 
If you'd like to know more, feel free to reach out to me! Contacts below, thank you!
